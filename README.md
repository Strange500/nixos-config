## 🏠 Why This Configuration Exists

After being a distro hopper for a year and a half - bouncing from basic Debian to Ubuntu (not customizable enough!), to Arch (breaking after each update 💥), and EndeavourOS - I finally discovered **NixOS**! 🎉 

It's highly customizable yet nearly unbreakable. Now I'm exploring the Nix world and trying different things, which led to this configuration serving as the foundation for **QGroget** - a personal computing ecosystem focused on reproducibility and self-hosting.

**The Journey:** From distro chaos to NixOS zen 🧘‍♂️  
**The Goal:** Create identical, reliable systems across multiple machines while maintaining a powerful homelab infrastructure.

**The Problem:** Setting up and maintaining multiple computers with consistent configurations is tedious and error-prone (especially after yet another Arch update breaks everything).

**The Solution:** NixOS with flakes provides declarative, version-controlled system configurations that ensure every machine is identical and reproducible - no more broken systems!

## 🖥️ What's Inside

### Desktop Systems

- **Security-First**: Age-encrypted secrets management, secure SSH configurations
- **Performance Optimized**: Tailored for development workflows and productivity

### QGroget Homelab Server
The server configuration powers a comprehensive self-hosted infrastructure at **qgroget.com**:
